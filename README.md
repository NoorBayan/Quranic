# The Quranic Treebank: A Comprehensive Linguistic Resource for Classical Arabic

Welcome to the **Quranic Treebank**, a groundbreaking linguistic resource meticulously crafted to unlock the rich and complex tapestry of Classical Arabic as manifested in the Holy Quran. This comprehensive dataset empowers scholars, linguists, computational researchers, and application developers with an unparalleled depth of information, enabling profound exploration into the intricacies of Quranic grammar, morphology, and syntax.

This resource is not merely a collection of text but a deeply annotated corpus, designed to be **computationally accessible and linguistically robust**, serving as a foundational benchmark for research and development in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Deep Dive into the Data Structure

The Quranic Treebank is organized as a primary tabular dataset (extended CoNLL-X format) where each row represents a token. The columns provide rich linguistic information:

### 1. Core & Positional Information
*   `tid`: Unique sequential identifier for each token entry.
*   `sentence_id`, `verse_id`, `word_id`, `tok_id`: Hierarchical identifiers for sentences (NLP-defined), Quranic verses, words, and tokens within words.
*   `location`: Traditional Quranic location code (Surah:Verse:Word:Token).
*   `chapter_id`: Numerical identifier for the Surah (Chapter).

### 2. Orthographic Representations
*   `uthmani_token` & `imlaai_token`: Token in Uthmani (Quran-specific) and Imlaai (standard CA) scripts.
*   `uthmani_unicode` & `imlaai_unicode`: Buckwalter transliteration for Uthmani and Unicode for Imlaai script.
*   `phonetic`: Phonetic transliteration of the token.
*   `trans`: English translation corresponding to the token/segment.

### 3. Morphological Analysis
*   `pos` & `pos_ar`: Part-of-Speech (POS) tags (English-based and traditional Arabic terminology).
*   `features`: Original morphological feature string (from source corpus).
*   `segment`: Identifies token as prefix, suffix, or stem.
*   `lemma` & `lemma_ar`: Word lemma (dictionary form) in transliteration/Unicode and Arabic script.
*   `root` & `root_ar`: Word root (typically triliteral) in transliteration/Unicode and Arabic script.
*   **Grammatical Features:** Detailed columns for `verb_form` (pattern), `prefix` type, `suffix` type, `verb_aspect` (perfect, imperfect, imperative), `nominal_state` (definite/indefinite), `verb_mood` (indicative, subjunctive, jussive), `nominal_case` (nominative, accusative, genitive), `derived_nouns` (active/passive participle, verbal noun), `verb_voice` (active/passive), `person`, `gender`, and `number`.

### 4. Syntactic Analysis (Hybrid Framework)
*   `special_group`: Identifies membership in special syntactic verb groups (e.g., *kƒÅna wa-akhawƒÅtuhƒÅ*).
*   **Dependency Relations:**
    *   `rel_label` & `rel_label_ar`: Syntactic dependency relation labels (English & Arabic terminology).
    *   `ref_token_id`: Identifier of the head token in the dependency relation.
*   **Constituency Analysis:**
    *   `is_constituent`: Flag indicating if the token heads a phrasal constituent.
    *   `constituent_node`: *(Recheck definition: previously 'Classification of binary constituent relations', might need clarification or renaming based on your exact schema)*
    *   `constituent_position`: Start and end token IDs defining the span of the constituent.
    *   `constituents`: Surface string of the constituent (Uthmani script).
    *   `constituent_label`: Syntactic category label of the constituent (e.g., Nominal Sentence (NS), Verbal Sentence (VS)).
